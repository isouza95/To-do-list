<!--
This just creates a new list. I did something a little different with mine than what he did with his.
I made mine so that clicking the button OR hitting enter will add a new list item. If you look at 
everything within the </form> tag, I added the onsubmit portion as well as removed the portion he had in
the </button> tag. His </form> tag read like this:

<form>
    <label for="new-todo">New Item: </label>
    <input 
        type="text" 
        id="new-todo" 
        name="new-todo" />
    <button type="button" onclick="addTodo()">Create</button>
</form>

While this works, it does exactly what it says. It only allows the button to be clicked. It does not allow
the user to hit enter which is a lot of people's natural habits. In fact, hitting enter cleared the screen
of all prior created list items. What I'm saying is it would actually be highly inconvenient. I believe 
this way works way better.
